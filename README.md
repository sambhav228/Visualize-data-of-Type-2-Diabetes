Visualize data of Type 2 Diabetes Using tableau or/and python

### ABSTRACT:

Diabetes is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide health care crisis. According
to International Diabetes Federation 382 million people are living with diabetes across the whole
world. By 2035, this will be doubled as 592 million. Diabetes mellitus or simply diabetes is a
disease caused due to the increase level of blood glucose. Various traditional methods, based on
physical and chemical tests, are available for diagnosing diabetes. However, early prediction of
diabetes is quite challenging task for medical practitioners due to complex interdependence on
various factors as diabetes affects human organs such as kidney, eye, heart, nerves, foot etc. Data
science methods have the potential to benefit other scientific fields by shedding new light on
common questions. One such task is to help make predictions on medical data. Data Visualization is
an emerging scientific field in data science dealing with the ways in which visualizing the historical
data. The aim of this project is to develop a system which can predict of type 2 diabetes for a patient
with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different Data Visualization techniques. This
project aims to predict diabetes via different Tableau methods including: Heatmap, Histogram etc..
This project also aims to propose an effective technique for earlier detection of the type 2 diabetes
disease.


### INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is one of deadliest diseases in the world. Many people have been struggling to control type
2 diabetes in the USA . Therefore, many of them are taking insulin to control it . Type 2 diabetes
may be managed by healthy eating and exercise . I recently came across the word “intermittent
fasting” and I also read that it may reverse diabetes based on the article . One of the popular
methods of intermittent fasting is the 16:8 method, meaning fasting for 16 hours and eating for the
remaining 8 hours according to . For example, a person can have dinner at around 6 p.m. and then
start eating breakfast around 10 am the day after which will give 16 hours of fasting window. Dr.
Jason Fung's study of three men with type 2 diabetes showed that they were able to stop insulin
treatment after following intermittent fasting . It is not only a disease but also a creator of different
kinds of diseases like heart attack, blindness, kidney diseases, etc. The normal identifying process is
that patients need to visit a diagnostic center, consult their doctor, and sit tight for a day or more to
get their reports. Moreover, every time they want to get their diagnosis report, they have to waste
their money in vain. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is defined as a group of metabolic disorders mainly
caused by abnormal insulin secretion and/or action. Insulin deficiency results in elevated blood
glucose levels (hyperglycemia) and impaired metabolism of carbohydrates, fat and proteins. DM is
one of the most common endocrine disorders, affecting more than 200 million people worldwide.
The onset of diabetes is estimated to rise dramatically in the upcoming years. DM can be divided
into several distinct types. However, there are two major clinical types, type 1 diabetes (T1D) and
type 2 diabetes (T2D), according to the etiopathology of the disorder. T2D appears to be the most
common form of diabetes (90% of all diabetic patients), mainly characterized by insulin resistance.
The main causes of T2D include lifestyle, physical activity, dietary habits and heredity, whereas
T1D is thought to be due to autoimmunological destruction of the Langerhans islets hosting
pancreatic-β cells. T1D affects almost 10% of all diabetic patients worldwide, with 10% of them
ultimately developing idiopathic diabetes. Other forms of DM, classified on the basis of insulin
secretion profile and/or onset, include Gestational Diabetes, endocrinopathies, MODY (Maturity
Onset Diabetes of the Young), neonatal, mitochondrial, and pregnancy diabetes. The symptoms of
DM include polyuria, polydipsia, and significant weight loss among others.



**Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly.

Visualize data of Type 2 Diabetes Using tableau or/and python

### ABSTRACT:

Diabetes is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide health care crisis. According
to International Diabetes Federation 382 million people are living with diabetes across the whole
world. By 2035, this will be doubled as 592 million. Diabetes mellitus or simply diabetes is a
disease caused due to the increase level of blood glucose. Various traditional methods, based on
physical and chemical tests, are available for diagnosing diabetes. However, early prediction of
diabetes is quite challenging task for medical practitioners due to complex interdependence on
various factors as diabetes affects human organs such as kidney, eye, heart, nerves, foot etc. Data
science methods have the potential to benefit other scientific fields by shedding new light on
common questions. One such task is to help make predictions on medical data. Data Visualization is
an emerging scientific field in data science dealing with the ways in which visualizing the historical
data. The aim of this project is to develop a system which can predict of type 2 diabetes for a patient
with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different Data Visualization techniques. This
project aims to predict diabetes via different Tableau methods including: Heatmap, Histogram etc..
This project also aims to propose an effective technique for earlier detection of the type 2 diabetes
disease.

**Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly.

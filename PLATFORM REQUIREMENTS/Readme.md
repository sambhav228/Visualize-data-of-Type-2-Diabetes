The **Data Visualizations** are built with the data sets and design decisions made earlier. I have used
bar charts of types â€“ vertical, stacked and side by side and other forms of visualizations such as
trees, tree-maps, bubbles charts, area charts, and line charts to visualize the data.

**Tableau** is one of the powerful business intelligence/ data analytics tools available in the market
and the desktop version that is available to students as free of cost and there is a public version is
also available free to other users . The advantages of Tableau include connecting any type of data,
dataset, a database such as CSV, Excel, plain text files, Oracle, and other forms. Tableau also gives
auto suggestions, on smart defaults for visual encodings, with filtering options such as year slider,
checkboxes, sorting, and aggregate options. And there are a lot of other options to explore as well.
